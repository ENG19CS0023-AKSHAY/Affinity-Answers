In this program the user can give free flowing address as the input.
An API call is made to  http://www.postalpincode.in/Api-Details for the purpose of PIN code identification.
If the address provided matches with the PIN code given it prints 'PIN code is correct and matches the address elements.' else it prints 'PIN code is incorrect for the provided address elements.'.
